            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
                <p>Despite being the color of the sky, blue was rare in nature, particularly as a natural material. Lapis lazuli, a blue gemstone, was an early commodity exported from the Middle East. It was as valuable as gold, and worn as jewelery by ancient peoples. When grinded down, lapis awarded the incredibly expensive pigment ultramarine. Since the color was so prized, it was often used in artwork to denote divinity. The process was particular, as grinding lapis too finely resulted in an unusable grey. It was in ancient Egypt where the first synthetic blue pigment, Egyptian blue, was created over 4,000 years ago. Prussian blue, synthetic ultramarine, indigo, and YInMn are only a few of the many blue pigments that have been developed across history. </p>

                <p>Yves Klein was a painter who famously incorporated blue into his work, especially among a series of monochromatic blue paintings. He eventually developed International Klein Blue, his signature shade.</p>
                    <blockquote>"Blue is the invisible becoming visible. Blue has no dimensions, it is beyond the dimensions of which other colours partake."<br> &mdash;Yves Klein</blockquote>

            <h2>Psychology and Symbolism</h2>
                <p>Blue is a calming color believed to promote productivity. It has numerous positive and wistful connotations, such as imagination, serenity, trust, and creativity. Negative connotations include sadness, the cold, and formality.</p>

                <p>Potentially due in part to its value in the ancient world, blue often symbolized sacred subjects important to religions. On a similar note, it implied wealth, royalty, and status.</p>
