        <p>This account from the first manned mission to the Challenger Deep, the deepest known point in the ocean, is likely erroneous, but it raises many enduring questions about life in the deep dark. | <a

        <p>"And as we were settling this final fathom, I saw a wonderful thing. Lying on the bottom just beneath us was
            some type of flatfish, resembling a sole, about 1 foot [30 cm] long and 6 inches [15 cm] across. Even as I
            saw him, <span style="color: rgb(191, 81, 42)">his two round eyes on top of his head spied us</span> – a
            monster of steel – invading his silent realm.
            Eyes? Why should he have eyes? Merely to see phosphorescence? The floodlight that bathed him was the first
            real light ever to enter this hadal realm. Here, in an instant, was the answer that biologists had asked for
            the decades. <span style="color: rgb(191, 81, 42)">Could life exist in the greatest depths of the ocean? It
                could!</span> And not only that, here
            apparently, was a true, bony teleost fish, not a primitive ray or elasmobranch. Yes, a highly evolved
            vertebrate, in time's arrow very close to man himself. <span style="color: rgb(191, 81, 42)">Slowly,
                extremely slowly, this flatfish swam away.
            Moving along the bottom, partly in the ooze and partly in the water, he disappeared into his night. Slowly
            too – perhaps everything is slow at the bottom of the sea </span> – Walsh and I shook hands."</p>
