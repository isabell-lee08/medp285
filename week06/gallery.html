                <blockquote>
                    <p>A thunderstorm is a rain shower during which you hear thunder. Since thunder comes from
                        lightning, all thunderstorms have lightning. </p>

                    <p>Thunderstorms can look like tall heads of cauliflower or they can have "anvils." An anvil is the
                        flat cloud formation at the top of the storm. An anvil forms when the updraft (warm air rising)
                        has reached a point where the surrounding air is about the same temperature or even warmer. The
                        cloud growth abruptly stops and flattens out to take the shape of an anvil.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Blood rain or red rain is a phenomenon in which blood is perceived to fall from the sky in the
                        form of rain. Cases have been recorded since Homer's Iliad, composed approximately 8th century
                        BC, and are widespread. Before the 17th century it was generally believed that the rain was
                        actually blood [...] There is now a scientific consensus that the blood rain phenomenon is
                        caused by aerial spores of green microalgae Trentepohlia annulata.</p>

                    <p>Recorded instances of blood rain usually cover small areas. The duration can vary, sometimes
                        lasting only a short time, others several days. By the 17th century, explanations for the
                        phenomenon had moved away from the supernatural and attempted to provide natural reasons.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a
                        region. Monsoons cause wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics. Monsoons are most
                        often associated with the Indian Ocean.
                    </p>

                    <p>Monsoons always blow from cold to warm regions. The summer monsoon and the winter monsoon
                        determine the climate for most of India and Southeast Asia.</p>
